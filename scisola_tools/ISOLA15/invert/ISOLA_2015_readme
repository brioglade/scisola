This is a new release of ISOLA.
===============================
(Fortran codes by J. Zahradnik, Matlab GUI codes by E. Sokos) 

New users should study instructions (examples) of the previous version:
http://geo.mff.cuni.cz/~jz/isola_brasilia/
However, new codes of this release would give slightly different results.

Major changes compared to the 'Brasilia version" include

1) All codes use causal filtration (both Fortran and Matlab).
2) All codes use allstat with  station-dependent frequency range.
3) Only 2 fiter values are used f1 and f4. Please prescribe f2=f1, f3=f4 if code still asks for 4 values.
4) Formal shifts of seismograms (50 seconds) are no more used. Seismograms start at t=0, equivalent to origin time.
5) Take-off angles are calculated as in standard location codes (all first arriving head waves are considered).
6) CSPS method is included in GUI = combination of polarities and waveforms
7) New output plot added to CSPS (Variance reduction vs. trial source number nad Mw)
8) Pearson's correlation coefficient added as output in the uncertainty calculation
9) Bugs were detected in and removed from the time-function calculation codes (time_fixed and timfuncas)
10) Uncertainty mapping inlcuded in GUI

HOW TO RUN:
Unzip the two folders of this distribution, copy them on C disk of your computer and and put these new folders  on your Windows system path INSTEAD of the analogous previous folders with the fortran and GUI codes.

COMPILATION:
If you need to edit ANY of the *.for code, compile it after edit, and then ALWAYS run COPYNEWNAMES.BAT. It is because GUI will still use the 'old' code names.

Recommendations:
a) Keep old codes; this new version is still under development.
b) It is always good if records have their start time 60-120 seconds before origin time.
